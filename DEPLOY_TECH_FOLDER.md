# 🚀 Deploy Your Tech Folder to Netlify

## ✅ Perfect! You can deploy your entire `tech` folder

Your `tech` folder contains everything needed for deployment and is now properly configured for Netlify.

## 📁 What's in Your Tech Folder:
- ✅ **Source code** - All your React components and pages
- ✅ **Built files** - The `out` folder with static files
- ✅ **Configuration** - `netlify.toml`, `package.json`, etc.
- ✅ **Email functionality** - EmailJS integration working
- ✅ **Assets** - Images, CSS, and all static files

## 🚀 3 Ways to Deploy Your Tech Folder:

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Sign up/Login** to your account
3. **Drag the entire `tech` folder** directly onto the Netlify dashboard
4. **Netlify will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Next.js project
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy the `out` folder
5. **Your site goes live!**

### Method 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. **Push your `tech` folder to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**
2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your Git provider
   - Select your repository
3. **Netlify will auto-detect settings:**
   - **Base directory:** `.` (root of tech folder)
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `out`
4. **Deploy!**

### Method 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from the tech directory
cd tech
netlify deploy --prod
```

## ⚙️ Netlify Configuration (Already Set Up)

Your `netlify.toml` is configured for the tech folder:

```toml
[build]
  base = "."                    # Root of tech folder
  publish = "out"              # Built files location
  command = "npm run build"    # Build command

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"          # Node.js version
```

## 📧 Email Functionality Status:
- ✅ **Contact form** - Fully functional
- ✅ **EmailJS integration** - Working
- ✅ **Email delivery** - Configured to `Ask@akenotech.com`
- ✅ **No backend needed** - Works directly from browser

## 🎯 Benefits of Deploying Tech Folder:

1. **Complete project** - All source files included
2. **Easy updates** - Can modify and redeploy easily
3. **Version control** - Full project history
4. **Flexibility** - Can add features later

5. **All pages accessible** ✅

## 📊 What Happens During Deployment:

1. **Netlify detects** your Next.js project
2. **Installs dependencies** with `npm install`
3. **Builds the project** with `npm run build`
4. **Generates static files** in `out` folder
5. **Deploys static files** to CDN
6. **Site goes live** with custom URL

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### If deployment fails:
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
